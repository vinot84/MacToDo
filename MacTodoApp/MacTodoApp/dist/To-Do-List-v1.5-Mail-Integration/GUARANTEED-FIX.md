## üîÑ WHY THIS KEEPS HAPPENING

- macOS Gatekeeper is designed to show this warning for ANY unsigned app
- Even our bypass scripts can't prevent the FIRST warning
- But once you override it ONCE, it never shows again
- This is Apple's intended security behavior

## ‚úÖ AFTER THE FIRST OVERRIDE

Once you use any method above:
- ‚úÖ MacTodoApp launches normally forever
- ‚úÖ No more security warnings
- ‚úÖ Works like any other Mac app
- ‚úÖ Can be opened from Launchpad, Dock, etc.

## üéØ THE KEY INSIGHT

**You MUST override the warning at least once.** There's no way around this for unsigned apps. Apple designed it this way intentionally.

**But it's completely safe!** The warning is just because we don't pay Apple $99/year for a developer certificate.

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY ASSURANCE

- ‚úÖ The app is completely safe
- ‚úÖ Source code is available for inspection  
- ‚úÖ No malware or tracking
- ‚úÖ Local data storage only
- ‚úÖ Open source integrations

## üì± WHAT HAPPENS AFTER OVERRIDE

1. **MacTodoApp launches successfully**
2. **Set up your integrations** (Settings ‚Üí Integrations)
3. **Configure Slack mentions** with your profile  
4. **Enjoy automatic todo creation** from Slack
5. **Use Quip & Chorus quick buttons**

**The security warning is normal and expected. Just override it once!** üöÄ
