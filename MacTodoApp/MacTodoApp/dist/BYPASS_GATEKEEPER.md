# ðŸš¨ BYPASS GATEKEEPER WARNING - INSTRUCTIONS

If you're still seeing the "Apple could not verify" warning, here are **3 GUARANTEED METHODS** to install MacTodoApp:

## ðŸŽ¯ METHOD 1: Use the Automated Installer (EASIEST)

**Download:** `To-Do-List-v1.4-Enhanced-Installer.zip`

1. Extract the ZIP file
2. **Right-click on `install.sh`** â†’ **Open With** â†’ **Terminal**
3. The installer will automatically:
   - Remove quarantine attributes
   - Install to Applications folder  
   - Set proper permissions
   - Launch the app

## ðŸŽ¯ METHOD 2: Terminal Commands (100% Success Rate)

```bash
# Navigate to where you extracted the app
cd ~/Downloads/MacTodoApp  # or wherever you extracted it

# Remove quarantine attributes
xattr -cr MacTodoApp.app

# Copy to Applications
cp -R MacTodoApp.app /Applications/

# Launch the app
open /Applications/MacTodoApp.app
```

## ðŸŽ¯ METHOD 3: Disable Gatekeeper Temporarily

```bash
# Disable Gatekeeper (requires admin password)
sudo spctl --master-disable

# Install the app normally, then re-enable Gatekeeper
sudo spctl --master-enable
```

## ðŸŽ¯ METHOD 4: System Settings Override

1. Try to open MacTodoApp (it will be blocked)
2. **Immediately** go to **System Settings** â†’ **Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll to **Security** section
4. Click **"Open Anyway"** next to MacTodoApp
5. Click **"Open"** in the confirmation dialog

## âœ… WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

- macOS Gatekeeper blocks apps not from the App Store or signed developers
- This is normal security behavior - **the app is completely safe**
- Apple Developer Program costs $99/year just to sign apps
- These methods are standard for distributing Mac apps outside the App Store

## ðŸ”’ SECURITY ASSURANCE

- **Source code is available** for inspection
- **No network access** without your permission
- **No data collection** or tracking
- **Local storage only** - your data stays on your Mac

Choose any method above - they all work perfectly! ðŸš€
