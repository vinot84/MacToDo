## üéØ To Eliminate Security Warnings Completely

To distribute MacTodoApp without any security warnings on macOS, you need to follow Apple's official code signing and notarization process.

## üìã Required Steps

### 3. Code Signing Process
```bash
# Sign the app with your Developer ID
codesign --force --options runtime --sign "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)" MacTodoApp.app

# Verify signing
codesign --verify --verbose MacTodoApp.app
spctl --assess --verbose MacTodoApp.app
```

### 4. Notarization (Required for macOS 10.15+)
```bash
# Create ZIP for notarization
zip -r MacTodoApp.zip MacTodoApp.app

# Submit for notarization

# Staple the notarization
xcrun stapler staple MacTodoApp.app
```
