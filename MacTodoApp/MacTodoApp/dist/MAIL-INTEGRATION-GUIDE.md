# 📧 MacTodoApp v1.5 - Mail Integration Added!

## 🆕 New Feature: Apple Mail Integration

MacTodoApp now integrates with Apple Mail to automatically detect action items and create todos when you're mentioned by name in emails.

## ✨ Mail Integration Features

### 🎯 Automatic Todo Creation
- **Action Item Detection**: Scans emails for keywords like "action item", "todo", "task", "please", "can you", "need you to", "follow up", "reminder", "deadline", "due by", "review", etc.
- **Name Mention Detection**: Creates todos when your name or email addresses are mentioned in emails
- **Smart Prioritization**: 
  - High priority for emails mentioning you directly or containing urgent keywords
  - Medium priority for emails with action items
  - Auto-generated due dates based on context

### 📝 What Gets Converted to Todos
- Emails where you're mentioned by name or email address
- Emails containing action-oriented language directed at you
- Follow-up requests and reminders
- Meeting action items sent via email
- Project updates requiring your input

### ⚙️ Configuration
1. **User Profile Setup**:
   - Display Name (e.g., "John Smith")
   - Username (e.g., "john.smith") 
   - Email Addresses (one per line):
     ```
     john.smith@company.com
     john@personal.com
     jsmith@work.org
     ```

2. **Mail Integration**:
   - Automatically detects Apple Mail.app
   - No complex authentication required
   - Uses AppleScript to access recent emails
   - Respects Mail.app privacy settings

## 🔄 How It Works

2. **Content Analysis**: Analyzes email subject lines and content for:
   - Your name mentions
   - Email address references  
   - Action-oriented keywords
   - Urgency indicators
3. **Smart Todo Creation**: Generates todos with:
   - Descriptive titles (e.g., "📧 You were mentioned: Project Update Required")
   - Email content preview in notes
   - Appropriate priority levels
   - Suggested due dates
   - Direct links back to the original email

### Integration with Other Services
- **Works alongside**: Slack, Quip, and Chorus integrations
- **Unified workflow**: All integrated todos appear in the same review interface
- **Consistent experience**: Same mention detection logic across all platforms

## 📱 Usage Examples

**Email Subject**: "Project Update Required"  
**Email Content**: "Hi John Smith, we need your input on the quarterly report. Can you review the attached documents by Friday?"

### Example 2: Action Item
**Email Subject**: "Action Items from Meeting"  
**Email Content**: "Following up on today's meeting. John - please complete the user research by next week. Thanks!"

**Result**: Creates medium-priority todo: "📧 You were mentioned: Action Items from Meeting" with due date of next week.

### Example 3: Follow-up Request  
**Email Subject**: "Reminder: Documentation Review"
**Email Content**: "This is a reminder that the documentation review is due tomorrow. Please send feedback to john.smith@company.com by EOD."

**Result**: Creates high-priority todo: "📧 You were mentioned: Reminder: Documentation Review" with due date of tomorrow.

## 🔗 Integration Features

### Email Links
- **Direct Access**: Click the todo to open the original email in Mail.app

### Privacy & Security

- **Mail.app Privacy**: Respects existing Mail.app privacy and security settings
- **AppleScript Only**: Uses standard macOS AppleScript - no external tools
